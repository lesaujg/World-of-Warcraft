## v4.9.36 Changes

[Retail Only] Blizzard has made significant changes to throttle Auction House activity, on the basis that using addons is harming the game. TSM Sniper has been disabled in the hope that Blizzard responds to requests to engage in discussion on how the TSM Team can contribute to improving the Auction House for everyone. Please consider sharing your feedback (politely) on the official forums: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/auction-house-much-slower-today/556722/
