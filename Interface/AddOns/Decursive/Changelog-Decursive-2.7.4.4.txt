Tagging as 2.7.4.4

- Performance improvements in certain conditions.


--------------------

Archarodim:
	- Update TOC for 2.7.4.4 release
	- Combat postponed function calls did not always report if they did something costly.
	This could allow several costly delayed function calls to be executed in a row (performance issue)...
