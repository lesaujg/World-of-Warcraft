Tagging 6.0.11, minor Travel Form usability fix.


--------------------

Mike "Xodiv" Battersby:
	- Use the blizzard names for table/string functions.
	- Comment about the flags vs C_MountJournal
	- Get mount info via method funcs every time. Because I'm a Real Programmer, with encapsulation, and blackjack and hookers. In fact forget the encapsulation.
	Also switch string.format to just format, mostly because it makes more of
	the line fit on my screen.
	- Move item flags into New() args, remove FlagOverrides table.
	- Properly call IsUsableSpell for Travel Form.
	- Note about badbadbad COMPANION_UPDATE cpu killer.
	- Branch-fu notes.
	- Notes to myself about git setup.
