Happy 2016 from your lazy developer!
I really want a more flexible mount choosing system but I haven't written it yet.
Instead have two custom user-settable flags and two extra keybinds to use them.


--------------------

Mike "Xodiv" Battersby:
	- Remove more debugging prints.
	- Remove a leftover debug message.
	- Morely working Options-fu.
	- Superficially working Options-fu.
	- Totally broken missing save.
	- Totally broken version of moving to the UI Panel Template.
	- Try using <Attribute>
	- Add test UI Panel Templates.
	- Shorter macro so it fits in 255 chars.
	- Fix compatibility click on core.
	- Use CaseAccentInsensitiveParse instead of strlower in /lmt
	- Update Macro for new button names.
	- Return core to being a button for macro back-compatibility.
	- Merge two more Set functions into accessors.
	SetCopyTargetsMount into CopyTargetsMount accessor
	  SetExcludeNewMounts into ExcludeNewMounts accessor
	- Merge SetUseGlobal into UseGlobal accessor
	- Remove the GetXxxMount wrapper functions in LM_PlayerMounts.
	Wrapper come. Wrapper go. I'm like Vanilla Ice up in here.
	- Bundling too many changes. WTB better developers.
	Move the mount rescan out of Core and into LM_PlayerMounts.
	Remove wrappers:
	    LiteMount:GetAllMounts()
	    LiteMount:ScanMounts()
	    Mount:IsExcluded()
	Use New() instead of new() for consistency.
	Add LM_PlayerMounts:Iterate() wrapper, just after I removed some wrappers.
	Merge EnableCombatMacro/DisableCombatMacro into UseCombatMacro in LM_Options.
	- More DEVELOPER_NOTES twiddling.
	- DEVELOPER_NOTES twiddling.
	- Comments. Clearly not a real programmer. OR AM I?
	- Comment was ALWAYS wrong. I can't even.
	- UI Filtering + uses CurrentFlags not Flags.
	- Fix search for c1/c2.
	- Few bug fixen for combatmacro UI.
	- Fix macro actions, oops my megabad.
	- Remove SetAsInCombatAction and call PostClick on setup.
	- Change some names for clarity.
	Names provide us with a way of structuring and mapping the world in our minds so, in some way, they mirror or represent the objects of our experience. -- from Wikipedia
	- Scrub-a-dub away all sign of LM_Action:SetAsMacroText
	- Assume C1/C2 can be localized to CUSTOM in zh locale.
	- custom1/2 were too long, change to C1/C2.
	- Try to migrate keybindings.
	- Fix CantMount dispatch problem.
	- Fix cooldown test in item summoned mounts.
	- Put " / Dismount" on the custom keybinding strings.
	- Be consistent about using PlayerHasItem. I guess.
	- Add macro to Custom1 and Custom2 buttons.
	- Fix bit text name. Bitbitbitbitbit.
	- No more sick up! Also fix item summoned stuff.
	- Still making me sick up.
	Change to 4 buttons, rename flags to CUSTOM1 and CUSTOM2.
	- I'm committing this because it's working. Even though I hate its ugly face. Yuk.
	- WTF permissions. GRRR.
	- Move ActionButton code out of Core. Try 5 action buttons for fun. Note that the bindings need to be moved.
	- Rescan on PLAYER_LEVEL_UP not UNIT_LEVEL
	- Spacing fix. In space noone can hear you scream.
	- Write 100 times on the blackboard. I must log in to test changes before committing.
	- Fixups! Rolling rolling rolling my stone up the hill. Be running up that road. Be running up that hill. Be running up that building. if I only could, oh.
	- Missing TOC for Action.lua. Add ground-only support back.
	- Typoe
	- Action List test. And tags. Again. I am the addon Sisyphus.
