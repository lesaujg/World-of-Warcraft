Release 7.0.9.
Only use Travel Form on the ground if you don't yet know Apprentice Riding.


--------------------

Mike "Xodiv" Battersby:
	- Flag Travel Form as a "walking" mount only if you don't know how to ride at all yet. I assume you'll buy a mount straight away? Argh.
	- Travel Form issues. Bleh. I liked it better when this was a real mount instead of a 40% weird thing.
