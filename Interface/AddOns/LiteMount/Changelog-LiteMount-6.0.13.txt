Prefer flying mounts to ground underwater in flyable areas.


--------------------

Mike "Xodiv" Battersby:
	- Hopefully fix logic with swim/fly mount order. Also maybe break Vashjir. Eek.
	- Update copyright notices for 2015.
	- Test the Garrison Ability for usability not the mount spell itself.
	- Nagrand mounts need to check spell usability too.
