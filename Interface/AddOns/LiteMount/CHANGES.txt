Still trying to fix Blizzard's error.
Clearly I have no idea what I'm doing, so here's some song lyrics:

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
