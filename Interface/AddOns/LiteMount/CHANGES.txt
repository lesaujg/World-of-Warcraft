LiteMount 9.0.4

Despite Artisan Riding being taken out of the game, it appears that level-
squished toons still know it instead of Expert Riding. And other toons only
know Expert Riding. Both have the same effect, you can fly.

Handle both cases.

    Check once again for both Expert Riding and Artisan Riding, because although
    you can't learn both any more, both still exist for randomly for different
    level-squished characters.
