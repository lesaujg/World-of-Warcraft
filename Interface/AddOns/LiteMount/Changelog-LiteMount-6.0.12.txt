Fix bug with unavailable macro usage.

Journal mounts were not checking spell usability so indoors and other areas
were always trying to be used, preventing unavailable macro unless moving.

Mike "Xodiv" Battersby:
	- Fix bug with unavailability.
	Journal mounts need to test spell usability. OOPS!
	- Finally remove the FlagOverride table.
	- Notes about checking every spell for surface.
