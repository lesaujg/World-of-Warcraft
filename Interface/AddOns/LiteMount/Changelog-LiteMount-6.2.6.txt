Match the Blizzard random mount logic for swimming:
  - Turtles aren't summoned when swimming (by default)
  - Water Striders are summoned when swimming (by default)
Manually change the flags in the settings to get the old behaviour back.


--------------------

Mike "Xodiv" Battersby:
	- Turtles no longer swim by default. Water Striders swim by default. To match how the Blizzard random mount magic works.
	- Move button debug print out of Mount to Core
