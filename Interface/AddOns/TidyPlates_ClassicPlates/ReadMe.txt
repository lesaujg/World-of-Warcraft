TidyPlates: ClassicPlates was created based on elements from other Tidy Plates themes.
LUA elements were mainly studied from Quatre Plates but a few other themes came into play.
Image scaling and overall theme concept was discovered by examining DaysofAlchemy.
The slight glassy look over the bars was a steal from the Graphite theme.

All in all, ClassicPlates is the result of <3 of many Tidy Plates themes.

Special Thanks to Avernus :)
