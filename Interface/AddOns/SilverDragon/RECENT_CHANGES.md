## Changed in v90001.5

* Refined waypoint options:
    * Blizzard waypoints are now equivalent to TomTom/DBM, not just a fallback, and you can choose all/none of them independently
    * Blizzard waypoints weren't being auto-removed on timeout correctly
    * An error could happen on auto-removal if you had TomTom *and* DBM enabled simultaneously
* Map overlay improvements:
    * Hover over a mob to show a highlight over all locations for that mob on the map
    * Click a pin (or the mob's name in the broker dropdown) to focus it so it always shows a highlight... now you can easily find a mob after seeing its name in the broker dropdown!
    * Shift-click a pin to link to it in chat (using your target popup settings)
    * Alt-click a pin to set a waypoint for it
* Add notes on Death Rising rares about their spawn order
* Fix a spawn location for Prince Keleseth
