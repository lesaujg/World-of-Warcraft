* Watch for known rares which announce themselves in chat (e.g. Arachnoid Harvester)
* Add the broker dropdown to the world map frame -- now you can look at the rare list with loot for any zone
* Add right-clicking on the target popup's close button to ignore the mob
* Allow the waypoint auto-clear timer to be set in 5 second increments
* Fix the target popup not showing up after combat ends if you noticed a rare during combat
* Cleaned up some of the warfront map locations
* Stop the achievement completed-by-alt check from behaving differently than whether your current character has completed it
