## Changed in v90001.7

* There's a ping highlight on the world map for:
    * the last seen mob when you open the map (within 30 seconds of seeing it)
    * a focused mob right when you focus it
* Mobs on the map overlay can be shift-right-clicked to immediately hide them
* Options for whether to show mobs on the edge of the minimap; by default, only focused ones are shown there
* Mobs on the map which are completed but shown anyway get slightly smaller icons (the "stars" theme did this already, but now it's consistent)
* The "ignore mobs that an alt has completed the achievement for" option was being ignored for mobs that had a vignette
* Some mobs (Basten) couldn't be hidden from the map... but now they can!
* Chat and vignette scanning now respect the "don't scan in instances" setting
