## Changed in v90001.2

* Special map icons for mobs with toys and pets as well
* Broker dropdown added to the mount journal, will show all known mobs that drop mounts (and whether you've looted them)
* Show mob variants in the dropdown, for things like the Mechagon Data Anomalies, Madexx, and the Zandalari Warbringers
* Chat-scanner: looks for mobs in the current zone with that name before checking globally in case of a name-collision
* Chat-scanner: only announce coordinates if it's from a chat event which implies the mob is anywhere near you (yells are zone-wide...)
* Waypoint integration with DeadlyBossMods
* If data on a toy/mount/pet is still loading, say that in the tooltip rather than not showing anything about it at all
* Mists: Nalak and Oondasta questids
* Fixed broken N'zoth and Azerite loot popup target themes
* Included updated version of LibQTip-1.0 which won't error if you have a broken pre-9.0 addon installed with an older version of LibQTip-1.0
