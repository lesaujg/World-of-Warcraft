* Shadowlands data: most of the new rares are included, with questids and loot. Some are still missing quests, but we've got time.
* Integration with "TomTom" is now "Waypoints", and can use the new built-in waypointing system or TomTom as you choose.
    * Ctrl-clicking the target popup will set a waypoint for the mob.
    * Shift-clicking the target popup will paste a clickable link to the mob to an open chatbox.
    * These waypoints will only be accurate for mobs detected through minimap vignettes, otherwise it's just going to point at wherever you were when you saw it.
    * The built-in waypointing can only have one waypoint at a time, so things like waypointing every spawn of a mob at once aren't possible.
    * If you already have a waypoint, SilverDragon will replace it and then try to restore it. (Or can be configured to not add waypoints if you already have one.)
* Added missing toys in Warlords, Mists, and Legion
* The macro targeting now better respects mobs that should be ignored
* Fixed target scanning to work in instances again
* Fixed chat scanning not opening the target popup
* Fixed an error from chat scanning in instances
* Fixed the id for Rukhmar
