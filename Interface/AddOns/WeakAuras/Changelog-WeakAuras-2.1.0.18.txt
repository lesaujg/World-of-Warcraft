--------------------

Infus:
	- Add more functions and objects to the blacklist
	A few obvious ones, there are probably more.
Benjamin Staneck:
	- fix untranslated option
Infus:
	- Add some more trade functions to the blocked list
	Might be the fix for
	Ticket: 459
	
	Or it might be a different isssue.
	- Text: Fix text sizes over 35 for initial aura
	I have no idea why moving SetTextHeight fixes that ticket,
	but it does.
	
	Ticket-number: 456
	- DBM Timer: Fix spellId condition
	Ticket-Nr: 457
	- Fix encounter id check
	We need to start the search on the next character
Benjamin Staneck:
	- fix a typo
Infus:
	- WeakAuras: Fix bars not being hidden after cinematic
	Ticket-Nr: 230
	- BigWigs Timer Trigger: Replace matching existing timers
	On getting a StartBar message, search for a bar that has the
	same addon, spellId and text and replace that.
	It seems that's what should happen on a second StartBar message,
	though I'm a bit unsure on whether that's correct.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 449
	- BigWigs Timer: Fix addon being intially nil
	Ticket-Nr: 446
	- Support multiple values in the encounter load condition
	Ticket-number: 447
	- Fix models not working in dynamic groups
	Ticket-Nr: 444
	- Add Potrait Zoom option to region type "Model"
	- Fix realm being unknown on log on.
Faithmelter:
	- Dialog as a Sound Channel
	Not sure if this has been left out for a good reason or not?, but I updated Types.lua to include the "Dialog" sound channel as a selection during WeakAura creation.
