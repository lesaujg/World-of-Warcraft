--------------------

Tzarc:
	- Keep a stack of the aura_env tables, so that they can be restored after using WeakAuras.ScanEvents().
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Internal => WeakAuras
Infus:
	- BuffTrigger: Fix Unknown affected players
	Sometimes GetUnitName returns UNKNOWN for some players in the raid/group,
	in those case just recheck the rost in 0.5s. And adjust the rest of the
	code, so that we always update the name, even if we alread know the guid.
	
	Ticket-number: 417
Benjamin Staneck:
	- re-enable frameLevel iterator in group and dynamicgroup, without resetting frameLevel to 0 before iterating for now, we'll see if we need it.
	- Fix typos in comments
	- touchup FAIAP lib
	- cleanup and start the frameLevel iteration in FixGroupChildrenOrder() at 1 instead of 2, also disable the frameLevel iterators in dynamicgroup and group region types
