--------------------

InfusOnWoW:
	- Fixes for Tickets (#34)
	* Fix Full Scan auras
	
	The removeSpellNames patch used as a logic that a trigger.spellId
	always trumps a name. For that to work, the full scan auras need
	to reset the spellId.
	
	Apparently in the past importing full scan auras was broken,
	since this is now done always changing full scan auras broke.
	
	Ticket-number: 516
	
	* Fix load events happening before the auras are loaded
	
	This broke again with the fix for the Archimonde radar,
	because the WeakAurasOptions registers the WeakAuras.ScanForLoad
	function too. Change that code to be a bit more explicit and fix
	the bug again.
	
	Ticket-number: 515
	
	* Glyphs: Add a tooltip listing the current glyphs
	
	That's the best we can do
