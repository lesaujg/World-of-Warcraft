--------------------

InfusOnWoW:
	- Various small fixes and features
	* Load Conditions: Add mystic dungeons
	
	* Add vehicle and hasVehicleUi load options
	
	Ticket-number: 254
	
	* Add glyph load option
	
	Just a minimal text field, since legion is changing how glyphs work
	anyway.
	
	Ticket-number: 140
	
	* Aurabar: Fix Spark being visible even if spark was not enabled
	
	Ticket-number: 508
	
	* Don't process load events before the auras have been added.
	
	This broke by the preparation for the stop motion addon.
	
	Ticket-number: 509
Infus:
	- Circular Progress: Fix pulse animation
	Scaling needs to scale the wedge too.
	
	Ticket-number: 503
	- Implement spark visibility option
	Add options to hide the spark on full or empty progress.
	Since the spark options are hidden by default this adds very little
	clutter.
	- Circular Progress: Full Progress should be start-end visible
	So, this goes back to the very first version I wrote. Full progress
	should be that the progress angle is equal to end angle.
	
	I confussed myself by mainly testing with buff triggers. Those go
	from full progress to no progress, thus confusingly but correctly
	they must from full to empty and move in the opposite direction.
	
	That is a clockwise buff trigger must move anti-clockwise.
	
	So that a resource trigger going from empty to full moves in
	clokcwise direction.
	
	This changes behaviour, but that's better in the long run.
	
	Ticket-number: 486
	- Texteditor: Split combined texts after edit
	If multiple auras (or a group) is selected, the texteditor combines
	the text. This patch adds code that splits the code after editing
	again.
	
	Ticket-number: 419
	- Fix aura trigger that use spellids after changing language
	Some time ago, I added support for using spellids instead of spell names
	to the aura trigger. Those spellids were only converted to spellnames
	in Transmission.lua, and thus on importing a aura.
	
	That meant that changing the language wouldn't update the spell names
	for those spellIds. By moving the code from Transmission.lua to
	WeakAuras.Add, we always do that and thus fix:
	
	Ticket-number: 269
	- Fix error on adding a trigger with a group selected
	I'm not 100% sure that this is the right fix, but it seems inline
	with what the other trigger_options are doing.
	
	Ticket-number: 45
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Revert "Backwards compat for 6.2.4; will be reverted on Thursday"
	This reverts commit 9f764fb2d435eac290db831739548dbceb5e509b.
