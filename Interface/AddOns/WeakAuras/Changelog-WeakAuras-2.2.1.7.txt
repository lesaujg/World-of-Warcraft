--------------------

Infus:
	- Fix ReleaseClone to actually store the clone into the right place
	Ticket-Nr: Github 113
	- Remove TODOs accidentaly left in the code
	- Correctly set WeakAuras.frames for the cdReadyFrame
	- Add Equipment Slot cooldown progress trigger
	Can check a arbitary slot for its progress information.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 215
	- Dynamic group Sorting: Add a check for a or b being nil
	No idea why table.sort would give us nil values.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 759
	- Model: Add a way to switch to the new SetTransform api
	Which allwos for more degrees of rotation and also isn't affected
	by the bug described in ticket: 696
	
	Ticket-Nr: 696
	- Fix error on renaming auras
	THe clones are released already and the clone table renamed.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 753
	- Remove custom code on exporting if the trigger is not in custom code mode
	Fixes slow transmissions and removes a few warnings for users importing
	auras that have old no longer used custom code.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 742
	- Use [[ ]] for most string interpolations
	Some user input can contain " and ', but is much less likely to
	contain [[ or ]]
	
	Ticket-Nr: 752, 505
	- Add a line number display in the top right corner
	Which can also be used to jump to a specific line. That isn't exactly
	what Ticket 549 asked for. But adding line numbers looks to be pretty
	complicated and this solves the problem of finding the line for a
	specific error message.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 549
	- Fix anchors of error message
	- Fix sorting of dynamic groups without expiration times
	Also introduced additional sort modes for hybrid.
