--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- More work on the frame level issue
	From the feedback I got, the workaround in the FixGroupChildrenOrder() call is not enough. So we now set the frameLevel to zero before increasing it one by
	one and also apply the double SetFrameLevel() workaround in all the other
	places where we have been using it.
	- Instead of using the Jack Input font (when it is available) we now use the Fira Mono font (when it is available)
