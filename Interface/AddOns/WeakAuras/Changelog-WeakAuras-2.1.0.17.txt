--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- make Unit Characteristics trigger work again
	- fix order so the faction load option actually works
	- Hack for neutral pandas
	- Add Faction load condition
Infus:
	- Eclipse Power: Remove "unit" option
	As no other power type trigger has a option for that.
	- Fix various power triggers to use 'player' instead of trigger.unit
	We can't check the ressources of other players anyway and the user
	can't actually change trigger.unit without changing to a diferent
	trigger type.
	
	Ticket-number: 435
	- Combo Points: Check UnitHasVehicleUI() in addition to UnitInVehicle()
	And presume only show vehicle combo points if both are true.
	
	Ticket-number: 420
Benjamin Staneck:
	- trigger alpha build
	- Fix to aura_env change
	- Ship our own version of a font for the advanced options editor, a slighly bolder one than we used before when the user had Prat installed
Infus:
	- EnsureClone: Only mark regions as justCreated, if they were created
	Ticket-number: 428
