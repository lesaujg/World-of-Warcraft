--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- block macro creation
	- Indents
	- add LibSpellRange-1.0 to the optdeps
	- Revert "Fix a typo"
	This reverts commit 36fe4627673059114e694b618ddeb85d4d27bb15.
	- Fix a typo
Infus:
	- Circle dynamicgroup: Fix placement of children
	Before afbce7f696587552b0dace3650006e2a992435f6
	numVisible was counted by code inside a
	"if data.grow == "HORIZONTAL" or data.grow == "VERTICAL"
	
	That patch moved the code to be always run, but forgot to remove
	code for the CIRCLE case that counted the children.
	
	Ticket-number: 491
Benjamin Staneck:
	- derp
	- add LibSpellRange-1.0 to pkgmeta
Infus:
	- Use LibSpellInRange to check for spell in range
	Checking with the spell name doesn't actually work reliable,
	the library contains a map from spellnames to spell book ids,
	which works better.

Tyler:
	- WeakAura Ticket 480 Add capability to specify a custom trigger combination function that will be run to decide whether the overall aura is triggered based on the status of the individual triggers. This enhances the current funcitonality of ANY or ALL triggers to allow complex logic, such as "Trigger 1 AND (Trigger 2 OR Trigger 3)"
	http://pastebin.com/Dw1nVVJs is an example aura using this change.
	
	Additionally, this change REMOVES the checks in Tranmission.lua:scamCheck that only showed code int the code review if the code was enabled. With this change, if their is custom code present in the WA when transmitted, the code is shown.
	
	remove checks in scamCheck that only showed enabled code. All code is shown in the transmitted aura
	
	http://pastebin.com/ki2heZzx is an example of an aura that (in today's client) would show as having no code, but after this change, exposes it has a large number of functions defined, but disabled.
