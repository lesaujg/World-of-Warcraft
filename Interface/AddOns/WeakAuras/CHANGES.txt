    Handle calling getRect on a child without a width or height
    
    Text regions don't have a width or height, so handling that in checkRect
    is correct. But somehow this code worked until a recent change, so
    maybe this is just a symptom

    Attaching works, but the options dialog doesn't show anything resembling
    the elvui frames.

    Fix ignore rune cd for "Epidemic"
    
    The ignore rune cd option makes wa compare the cooldown duration
    returned by GetSpellCooldown with the cooldown of a rune to figure
    out whether the cooldown returned by GetSpellCooldown is only
    because of missing runes.
    
    This fails for Epidemic, since the cooldown duration of that spell
    is identically with the cooldown rotation for runes.
    
    Fortunately, Epidemic is a spell with charges and thus in reality
    GetSpellCharges is used. And that api never returns the rune
    cooldown even if a spell is unuseable. Thus if we have charges
    we don't need to check runeDuration vs duration.
