--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- Revert "embed LibStataFix"
	This reverts commit 15ace569b5afe0f1459107237287daccf88253a4.
Infus:
	- Close the options dialog on entering combat
	Since Warlords of Draenor WoW simply interrupts addons that take
	to long while in combat. Since especially importing takes quite
	long, WoW can interrupt us in the middle of importing. That then
	might leave our internal data in a inconsistent state.
	
	I could reproduce the issues reported in ticket number 183 after
	3 tries in trying to import in combat.
	
	So on entering combat we close the options dialog and reopen it
	afer combat.
	
	Ticket-number: 183
Benjamin Staneck:
	- whitespace
Infus:
	- Fix appendToTriggerPath/appendToUntrigger path being nil
	Ticket-number: 324
Benjamin Staneck:
	- fix typo in CanHaveAuto()
