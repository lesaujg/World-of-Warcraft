--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Remove reference to Nameplates.lua from the ToC so people who aren't properly updating aren't attempting to load a file that hasn't existed for five versions. Pro tip: Completely delete an AddOn folder before updating.
	- Add another iconID for vignette detection.
