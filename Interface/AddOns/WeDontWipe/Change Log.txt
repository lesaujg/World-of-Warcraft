* Added silent chat command /wdw gcd to show the current GCD for current toon

* Several API calls have had parameters and return values altered, some with big changes
* Updated author & copyright notices to reflect my current personal, game & AddOn status
* Removed the Mage Polymorph code as no longer relevant. R.I.P. the lovely poly glyphs

=====
* Added specific DK code for Glyph of Icy Touch giving a purge to DKs

* Had to add specific Enh. Shaman code due to Blizzard smoke and mirrors with Stormblast

=====
Big Changes
-----------
* Designed to support classes/specs from level 1 to 90 (1-9 has no specialisation)

* If target is a player then the usual target information text replaced with some basic player relevant stuff
* Interface options panel better organised, some rewordings
* Friendly audible login welcome sound, tailored for races
* New error, warning, debug messages. Colour coded. And the old standard 'print' message too

* Interface options panel cleaned up but still has that cozy "Ace" feel (Core + Interface)
* Removed "Ace" as a dependancy. WDW now its own boss (Core + Interface + TOC)
