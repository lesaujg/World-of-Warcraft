Releasing v2.0.6 - WoW 7.1.0 support


--------------------

Brizag:
	- Automatically fill in the version in TOC
	- Change TOC for WoW 7.1.0. Fix error from OnHyperlinkLeave API change.
	- For now, revert the making of function T local.
	Yes, it is very bad that we leak T into global scope, but it is used in XML and making it local breaks stuff
	- Prevent some names from leaking into global scope.
	Thanks for Vladinator for pointing out.
