v5.2


--------------------

Nico Weichbrodt:
	- Bump toc to 6.2
	- Added option for starfall suggestion at 3 starsurge charges.
	- Calculate next spell to cast after gcd has finished after an instant cast during the gcd.
	- Better CA during peak handling, still a bit wonky, but better than before
	- Some minor improvements.
	- Fixed opacity during fight, was broken in beta release
	- Fixed dragging of the frame not setting the position after a reload/relog
	- Removed "wrong cast color" option, the spell icon is no longer tinted because we just calculate the next spell anyway. Better energy prediction at peak values, this should fix the "wrath at lunar peak" bug. Added an option for empowered moonkin: glow icon when buff is up for all spells or only for spells with cast times. Better lunar/solar transition suggestions: we now calculate the correct eclipse bonus for each phase and suggest the spell with more eclipse bonus.
	- Hold energy display if casting "wrong" spell and show correct energy for current spell. Do not show the spell which should have been cast but instead calculate the next spell based on the current one.
