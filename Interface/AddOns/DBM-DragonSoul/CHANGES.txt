    Migrated all mods to new countdown feature
    Bumped TOC files
    Disabled Model viewer playsoundfile in mods to avoid lua errors (since these aren't converted to soundkit yet)
    Updated some textures to use file data id instead of texture path, in some legacy mods that still use direct textures instead of GetSpellTexture
